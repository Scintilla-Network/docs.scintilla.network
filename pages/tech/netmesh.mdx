# Network Mesh

The Network Mesh in Scintilla is an overlay to the core blockchain, that helps to secure and orchestrate the ecosystem's various modules, including smart contracts, banking, identity, and more. 

It employs a unique consensus mechanism provided by Coordinator nodes that balances efficiency, security, and scalability, making it the bedrock upon which all other functionalities interoperate and interconnect with the core SCT blockchain.

By leveraging the unique features of the Mesh, developers can create innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in the blockchain space.

# What Makes The Mesh Unique?

- **Interoperability, IBC and Cosmos Hub**: Facilitates seamless communication and transaction across different blockchain networks, enhancing the network's flexibility and reach. Connected to IBC, it allows for direct integration within he Cosmos ecosystem.

- **Scalability**: Provides the infrastructure necessary for scaling the network horizontally, supporting an increasing number of transactions without compromising on speed or security.

- **Security**: The Mesh's consensus mechanism is designed to maximize security, ensuring that the network remains robust against attacks while maintaining decentralization.

# Connecting modules to the Mesh

The Mesh is the glue that connects the higher layers of the Scintilla Network, enabling them to function cohesively as a single, unified ecosystem. Through a series of protocols, the Mesh facilitates communication and interoperability among the different modules, ensuring that they can securely share data and transactions.
