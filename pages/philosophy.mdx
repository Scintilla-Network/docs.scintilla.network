## Philosophy

Scintilla embodies a distinct vision for the future of a more interactive and decentralized internet.

Our community is united by the conviction that transactions, data, and interactions should be plentiful and freely accessible.
We advocate for a world where users have the autonomy to both offer and utilize applications without the oversight of central authorities, devoid of constraints, and minus the necessity for trust.
By facilitating transactions at nearly zero cost, we open the door to widespread participation in the network.
By allowing any module to join the network, given at least one validator's support, we pave the way for limitless innovation.
By simplifying the process for anyone to generate tokens, establish DAOs, their governance structures, and digital identities, we're crafting the foundations for a new, more open, transparent, and equitable internet.
Moreover, by fostering the creation of reputations within a trustless framework, linked to an automated budget system, we ensure the network's ability to self-regulate and evolve autonomously as long as it remains operational.

Scintilla is a decentralized, open-source, scalable, permisionless, anti-fragile protocol that take a stance on a data and computation abundance.
