## Consensus Machine

The consensus machine application is a specific tool that allow the creation of new consensus.
Those are programmable (- via smart-scripts), or fetchable (- via oracles) and can be used to create a new consensus.

### Consensus Machine - Smart Scripts

The smart scripts are a way to create a new consensus by writing a script that will be executed by the smart script module.
The execution of the module is customizable to ensure a variety of nodes perform the same computation, and the result is then used to agree on a new consensus.

### Consensus Machine - Oracles

The oracles are a way to create a new consensus by fetching data from a specific source.
The data is then stored into the Data Storage Module and can be integrated to ensure the oracle request is performed upon a data change trigger or a smart-script call.
