## RWA Dashboard

Within the Scintilla ecosystem, the RWA Dashboard is a simple application that allows users to view, create, manage and interact with RWA tokens.

## Overview

Provided that a user has an Identity, they can create a new RWA token, view their existing RWA tokens, and interact with them.
This features requires various interactions with other Scintilla modules, such as the Identity module, the Bridge module, Smart Scripts and Data triggered scripts.
Connected with the Market Module, those RWA tokens can then be used outside of the Scintilla ecosystem on an EVM or Stellar chain.

## Features

- **Token Creation**: Users are able to create new RWA tokens (fungible or non-fungible) and define their properties.
- **Token Management**: Users can view and manage their RWA tokens and allow specific regulations to be applied to them (such as only KYC-verified users).
- **Token Interaction**: Users can interact with their RWA tokens, such as transferring them to other users, staking them in a dapp, transfer them outside of Scintilla or burning them.
