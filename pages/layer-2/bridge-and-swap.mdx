## Bridge & Swap

Within the Scintilla ecosystem, the bridge and swap decentralized-application is a component that will allow users to transfer assets between chains.

## Overview

Each validators of the Market Module will be able to participate in the bridge by depositing assets to the bridge and receiving a share of the bridge's income.
The bridge's income is generated by the fees that are charged to the users that transfer assets between chains, in the case of a transfer that also requires a swap between the assets, the bridge will charge an additional fee.
Those income are then distributed accordingly to various factors (liquidity provided, chain bridged to, oracles and linked reputation etc.) to the participants in the bridge.
Linked to the Identity, the bridge and its swap service will also be able to provide a way for regulated STO and RWAs to be traded, and swap from/to the Scintilla Network.

## Supported Chains

- Ethereum (and all EVM compatible chains: BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, DAI, etc.)
- Cosmos (and all IBC compatible chains: Terra, Binance, etc.)
- Stellar (and trustline assets)
- Scintilla Network


## Economic Model

Each participant in the bridge will be able to deposit assets to the bridge and receive a share of the bridge's income.
The bridge's income is generated by the fees that are charged to the users that transfer assets between chains.
The fees are distributed to the participants in the bridge according to their share of the bridge's liquidity.
Oracles are used to determine the exchange rate between the assets on the different chains.
Scintilla Governance inherit a small part of the fees to fund the development of its ecosystem.

## Security

The bridge is a decentralized and trustless system that is secured by the validators of the Bifrost module.
As such, a consensus needs to happen between the validators in order to move any assets.
All those operations are transparent and can be verified by anyone.
The bridge is also secured by the oracles that are used to determine the exchange rate between the assets on the different chains.
Additionally, thoses participants are required to keep the full connectivity to the chains they are bridging to.
Validators that are providing such connectivity are rewarded with an additional connectivity usage income (on top of the fees income), which incentives them to keep the connectivity up and running.
Upon a transfer request to a multi-signature controlled address on the external chain, and after ensuring it's validity, the validators will then perform the transfer to the target chain.
Finally, multiples requirements are in place to ensure the security (from the maximum transfer amount, to the maximum transfer frequency, to the maximum transfer amount per address, etc.) always ensuring that each validators have more liquidity available at stake than the transferred amount.

## Liquidity balancing

The bridge will also have a liquidity balancing mechanism that will allow the bridge to maintain a balanced liquidity between the different chains.
This will require the bridge to enable with the ability to swap assets between the different chains.
