## Bridge & Swap Application

The Scintilla ecosystem introduces a pivotal decentralized application for bridging and swapping assets, designed to enable seamless asset transfers across various blockchain networks, facilitate the exchange of assets within the Scintilla Network and enable for the growth of the Scintilla ecosystem by providing clear immediate incentives to participants of the nascent network.

## Overview

Validators within the Liquidity Module play a crucial role in the operation of the bridge, contributing assets to bolster the bridge's liquidity and, in return, earning a portion of the bridge's transaction fees.
These fees arise from charges applied to users transferring assets between chains, with additional fees imposed for transfers necessitating asset swaps.
The distribution of these earnings is determined by several criteria, including provided liquidity, targeted chain, oracle usage, and associated reputations.
This system ensures a fair compensation model for validators participating in the bridge operations.

Validators are responsible entities that ensure the security and integrity of the bridge's operations, validating asset transfers and swaps across connected chains, maintaining connectivity to supported chains, and ensuring the accuracy of exchange rates through oracles.
They are paid to service the protocol by fees and rewards, and are required to stake a significant amount of assets to participate in the bridge's operations, ensuring their commitment to the network's security and reliability.

Integrating with the Identity Module, the bridge and its swap functionality can also support the trading of regulated Security Token Offerings (STOs) and Real-World Assets (RWAs), facilitating their exchange within and beyond the Scintilla Network.
The user interface for these services is primarily delivered through the LEX Module, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
Linked to the Identity module, the regulatory compliance of the bridge and swap services will be ensured, allowing for the trading of regulated STOs and RWAs, and the swap from/to the Scintilla Network.

## Supported Chains

The bridge extends its interoperability across a wide array of blockchain networks, including:

- **Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains**: Such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Arbitrum, and others, enabling a broad reach across the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Cosmos and IBC-compatible chains: Enabling seamless asset transfers across the Cosmos ecosystem, including the Scintilla Network and into Stellar or Ethereum.
- **Stellar**: Including its trustline assets, offering unique financial instruments and opportunities.
- **Scintilla Network**: Serving as the foundational platform for these cross-chain interactions.

## Economic Model

Participants in the bridge ecosystem can deposit assets into the bridge's liquidity pool and receive income based on the bridge's accrued transaction fees.
These fees, generated from asset transfers and swaps, are proportionally distributed among liquidity providers according to their contribution.
Exchange rates for cross-chain transactions are accurately determined using oracles, ensuring fair value exchanges.

A nominal portion of transaction fees is allocated to Scintilla Governance to support ongoing ecosystem development, maintaining and expanding the network's capabilities.

## Security

The bridge operates as a decentralized, trustless system underpinned by the Bifrost module's validators.
Achieving consensus among validators is essential for any asset movement, ensuring a secure and verifiable process.
The system's integrity is further bolstered by oracle services for exchange rate determination and stringent connectivity requirements for validators, who are incentivised to maintain robust links to supported chains.

Security measures include transaction limitations to manage liquidity risks effectively, requiring that validators' staked liquidity always exceeds the total amount transferred.

## Liquidity balancing

A sophisticated liquidity balancing mechanism ensures the bridge maintains optimal liquidity across connected chains. This feature enables the bridge to autonomously rebalance its assets, preventing liquidity shortages or surpluses on any given chain.
By facilitating asset swaps as part of its balancing strategy, the bridge enhances its efficiency and responsiveness to changing market dynamics.

This documentation outlines the integral role of the Bridge & Swap mechanism within the Scintilla ecosystem, highlighting its contribution to seamless asset interoperability, economic incentives for participants, and robust security measures ensuring safe, reliable cross-chain transactions.
