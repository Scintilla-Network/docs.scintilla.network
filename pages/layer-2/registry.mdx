## Module Dependencies

The functionality of the Registry is supported by two critical modules within the Scintilla Network:

### Data Module

The Data Module plays a crucial role in the Registry's operations, handling the secure storage and efficient retrieval of identity-related data.
It ensures that identity information is accessible when needed, while maintaining privacy and security standards. This module's capabilities include:

- **Secure Storage**: Safely stores identity and reputation data, employing encryption and other security measures to protect user information.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Allows for quick access to stored identity data, facilitating verification processes and identity transfers within the network.

### Identity Module

Working in tandem with the Data Module, the Identity Module is integral to the functioning of the Registry. It oversees the lifecycle of digital identities and the associated reputation system, providing the following functionalities:

- **Identity Creation and Management**: Offers tools for creating and managing digital identities, including updates and transfers.
- **Reputation System Integration**: Incorporates a reputation system that tracks and displays the reliability and trustworthiness of entities within the Scintilla Network.

## User Experience

The Registry is a foundational element of the Scintilla Network, enabling secure and straightforward management of digital identities and reputations.
By leveraging the combined strengths of the Data and Identity Modules, the Registry empowers users to establish trust and maintain control over their digital presence.
As the Scintilla Network continues to evolve, the Registry will remain a central pillar in its architecture, facilitating seamless and trustworthy interactions in the digital realm.
Our main goal with this registry, is to consider addresses as the user identifier of an identity, and that user can just use what they always used: their username.
