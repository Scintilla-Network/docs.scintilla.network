# Roadmap: Next Steps for Scintilla

Scintilla is committed to continuous improvement and expansion of its blockchain ecosystem. Below is a concise summary of the upcoming features slated for implementation, with no particular order or time (as this depends on the community governance proposals and funding decisions after launch):

## Bridge & Swap Application
- **Implementation of a Trustless Bridge**: To facilitate secure asset transfers between Scintilla and other major blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Cosmos, and Stellar.
- **Swap Mechanism Integration**: Introduction of a decentralized exchange functionality within the bridge to enable seamless asset conversions.
- **Validator-Managed Liquidity Pools**: Establishing a system where validators can contribute to the bridge's liquidity and earn a share of the transaction fees.
- **Regulatory Compliant Trading**: Integration with the Identity Module to support compliant trading of regulated securities and real-world assets.

## LEX Module
- **Introduction of the LEX Protocol**: An extension to the Liquidity Module, focusing on lending and borrowing services within the Scintilla Network.
- **Yield Generation for Lenders**: Enabling users to earn interest by supplying liquidity to the LEX pool.
- **Collateralized Loans Against RWAs**: Facilitating the creation of loan products backed by real-world assets, thus promoting the influx of external capital into the network.

## Liquidity Module
- **Expanded Liquidity Management Tools**: Rollout of advanced features for validators and users to better manage and allocate liquidity within the network.
- **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Integration**: Seamless connection with the IBC protocol to enhance cross-chain liquidity flows.
- **Staking Options for Non-Validators**: Providing options for non-validator users to stake their assets and contribute to network liquidity.

## Smart Contract Module
- **Full EVM Compatibility**: Ensuring complete support for Ethereum smart contracts, allowing for easy porting and deployment on Scintilla.
- **Smart Contract Developer Toolkit**: Release of an updated SDK with improved documentation and tutorials to aid developers in creating and testing smart contracts.

## Smart Data Module
- **Launch of the Smart Data Store**: Deployment of a decentralized data storage solution integrated with Scintilla's blockchain modules.
- **Trigger-Based Execution**: Implementation of data change triggers to activate corresponding smart contracts or scripts.

## Smart Scripts Module
- **Server-Side JavaScript Execution**: Introduction of a secure environment for executing JavaScript-based smart scripts.
- **Pre-Paid Script Execution**: Allowing users to pre-fund script executions, enabling delayed or event-triggered runs.
- **Isolated Execution Environments**: Creating sandboxed environments for each script to ensure network safety and data integrity.

## IBC Integration
- **Native IBC Support**: Building direct IBC connections to enable interoperability with other IBC-enabled blockchains in the Cosmos network.
- **Cross-Chain Asset Movement**: Simplifying the transfer of assets across heterogeneous blockchain networks.
- **Enhanced DeFi Capabilities**: Broadening the potential for decentralized finance applications by connecting with larger liquidity pools and markets.

## RWA Dashboard
- **User-Friendly RWA Management Interface**: Designing an intuitive dashboard for users to issue, track, and interact with real-world asset tokens.
- **Compliance Frameworks for RWAs**: Embedding regulatory compliance checks within the RWA lifecycle management process.
- **External Chain Interactivity**: Empowering users to leverage RWA tokens across various external blockchain ecosystems, such as Ethereum and Stellar.
