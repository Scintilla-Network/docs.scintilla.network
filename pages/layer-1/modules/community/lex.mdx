## LEX

The LEX (Lending and Exchange) Module is a community module - under the patronage of the Thorstein DAO - that aims to provide
many of the liquidity module feature to users.
Extending the features of the liquidity module, the LEX module will allow users to lend their assets to the protocol and earn interest on them.

This should provides with many benefits, including:

  * A new source of yield for users and the protocol (which will makes the protocol budget more sustainable and less dependent on the emission of new tokens)
  * A new source of liquidity for the protocol - allowing new programmable interactions within the dapps and modules.
  * A new source of borrowing for the users - allowing RWA-accumulating strategy and incentivizing external people to bring their real-asset in exchange for lombard-loan.
