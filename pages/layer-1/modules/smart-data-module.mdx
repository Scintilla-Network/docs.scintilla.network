## Smart Data Module

### Overview

Smart Data Module (SDM) is a data storage and retrieval system that is designed to be used in conjunction with the Scintilla blockchain's modules.

It is a data store that is designed to be used by smart contracts or scripts to interact with specific data.

The SDM is designed to be able to execute a trigger upon specific data being added/updated/deleted, which allows for the creation of smart contracts that can react to specific data changes.
