# Smart Scripts Module

## Overview

Smart Scripts offer a flexible way to execute JavaScript code on the server side, within a safe, sandboxed environment.
Designed for efficiency and scalability, these scripts can be pre-paid, allowing for execution at a later time without real-time interactionâ€”similar to how Smart Contracts operate.
Unlike traditional scripts that run continuously, Smart Scripts can be executed on demand, especially in response to specific data changes, through the Smart Data Trigger mechanism.

This innovative approach is particularly useful for:

- Automating tasks based on data changes without manual intervention
- Implementing complex business logic that responds dynamically to blockchain state
- Enhancing security by isolating script execution in a sandboxed environment
- Allowing for fast-paced development and deployment of new features (providing with function atomic-level updates capabilities)

## How It Works

Smart Scripts are created and deployed by users, who specify the conditions under which the scripts are triggered. These conditions can range from simple, such as a time-based trigger, to complex, like data-driven events on the blockchain.

```jsx
function myCounter() {
  console.log("Smart Script executed!");
  let counter = 1;
  return {
    counter,
    increment: function() {
      counter++;
      return counter;
    },
  }
}
```

It will then be deployed in its own isolated environment and accessible via its Registry address (user.scintilla/apps/myCounter).

The SDK provides a simple way to interact with Smart Scripts, allowing users to execute them, pass parameters, and retrieve the results.

### Deploying a Smart Script

Once deployed, the scripts are executed in a secure, isolated environment on the server. Users pre-pay for the execution, ensuring that the scripts can run without further financial transactions or manual triggers.

This provides users with :

- Flexibility: Execute scripts on-demand or automatically based on predefined conditions.
- Security: Sandboxed execution environment protects the main application and data integrity.
- Cost-Efficiency: Pre-paid model eliminates the need for continuous transaction fees.

**Use Cases:**
Smart Scripts can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

- Data Validation: Automatically check and correct incoming data for consistency and accuracy.
- Automated Alerts: Send notifications based on specific blockchain events or state changes.
- Decentralized Oracles: Update smart contracts with real-world data in a secure and automated manner.

### Getting Started

*For the purpose of this guide, we will use the `@scintilla/sdk` package to interact with the Smart Scripts module.*

*Pending the release of the SDK for further details.*
