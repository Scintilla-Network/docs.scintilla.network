## Bifrost

The Bifrost module is the module locally ran by a validator to handle the pinning of modules to the blockchain.
As such, it also handles the management of L1 peers, connectivity with the L0 network (to allow for those module hashes to be pinned on L0), and the management of the L1 interconnectivity.
As the Scintilla Network is a sharded network, the Bifrost module will be main responsible for the management of the shards and the communication between them.
