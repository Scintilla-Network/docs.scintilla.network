## Permissionless Modules

Scintilla Network is a permissionless network, and as such, it is possible for anyone to create a module and convince validators to pin its modulehash.
This allows the network to be totally organic, adaptive, flexible and upgradable; It prevent struggles such as observed in the "Coffee War" of early Bitcoin - currency vs store.
It allow for competitiveness while keeping some stability on standards (such as the Identity and attached reputation).
As such, Scintilla Network could have a whole evolutionary-like ecosystem in one of its subnet - as Scintilla is a protocol to create consensus machines more than a set of blockchain - and yet to still use the Identity benefits and Assets (IBC compatible) mechanisms.

## Core Module vs Community Module

Core modules are specific as they are under the patronage of the Tech Governance Appointed DAOs.
As such, they can be represented as "required" to be ran on each validators, and therefore, safely assume its usage in layer 2 or another layer 1 module.

Community modules are "only" under the patronage of the community (if applicable, technically - a private module can be created by a validator if he see fits, but he might be the only module pinner).
