## Permissionless Modules

Scintilla Network provides a permissionless framework, allowing anyone to innovate and extend the network capabilities without any authorization or permission.
The open architecture fosters organic growth, innovation and adaptability-upgradability.

### Power of Permissionless: Organic innovation

In a permissionless setting, developers are free to design and deploy their modules, contributing to the network's evolution.
By persuading validators to recognize and pin their module hash, these new modules can become integral parts of the Scintilla ecosystem.
This approach mitigates past challenges seen in blockchain communities, such as the "Coffee War" debates in Bitcoin's early days, by accommodating diverse functionalities and visions within a single network.

This approach allows for a competitive and innovative environment, while maintaining a degree of stability through standardized core modules, such as those handling identity and reputation systems.
It makes the network organic, adaptive, flexible, and upgradable, and allows for a whole evolutionary-like ecosystem in one of its subnets.

## Core Module vs. Community Module

Within the Scintilla Network, modules are categorized into two distinct types: Core Modules and Community Modules, each under different stewardships and serving unique roles within the ecosystem.

### Core Modules

Core Modules are essential components of the Scintilla Network, overseen by Tech Governance Appointed DAOs. These modules are considered fundamental for the network's operation, often required to run on all validators. This designation ensures their universal availability and reliability for integration in higher-layer applications or other Layer 1 modules. Core Modules typically encompass critical functionalities such as the consensus mechanism, identity verification, and asset management.

### Community Modules

Community Modules, on the other hand, embody the network's permissionless ethos.
They are developed and maintained by the broader community or individual entities, offering specialized functionalities that extend beyond the scope of Core Modules.
While not mandatory for validators to run, these modules can be adopted and pinned by validators who wish to support or utilize their capabilities.
This category allows for a rich diversity of applications and services within the Scintilla ecosystem, from niche financial instruments to novel decentralized applications.

Community Modules can range from publicly beneficial tools to private modules created for specific purposes by individual validators.
Their adoption and utility are determined by community interest, validator support, and the value they add to the network.

### Modules Budget

Every module that has recognized valuable by the community and been pinned at least by 1/10th of the validators can request a funding from the network.
