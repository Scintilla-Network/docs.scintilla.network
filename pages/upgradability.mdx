## Upgradability

Scintilla is designed with upgradability at its core, enabling the network to evolve and adapt over time.
Initially, Scintilla leverages the advanced technology developed by the Cosmos ecosystem community to power its foundational layer (Layer 0).
This strategic choice facilitates the establishment of a self-sustaining network, setting the stage for ongoing enhancements and refinements across Layers 1 and 2.

### Layer 0: Foundation and Flexibility

At Layer 0, Scintilla harnesses Cosmos' robust framework to ensure foundational stability while maintaining the flexibility needed for future upgrades.
This approach allows Scintilla to benefit from the Cosmos community's innovations, ensuring the network remains at the forefront of blockchain technology.
As the network matures, Scintilla aims to incorporate advancements that further its mission of creating a scalable, interoperable, and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

### Layer 1: Modular Upgrades
Within Layer 1, the architecture of Scintilla is modular, with each module operating independently.
This modular design simplifies the upgrade process, as enhancements to individual modules can be implemented without necessitating consensus across the entire network.
Each module is governed by its specific set of rules and governance structure, ensuring that upgrades align with the module's objectives and community expectations.

- **Independent Upgrades**: Modules can be upgraded independently, allowing for targeted improvements without impacting the broader network.
- **Localized Governance**: Local governance mechanisms oversee module upgrades, ensuring decisions are made by those most affected by the changes.
- **Seamless Transitioning**: Modules can be duplicated and beta-tested (e.g., "identity-v2") with a synced data store, facilitating smooth transitions between versions and minimizing disruptions during significant governance shifts.

### Ensuring Smooth Upgrades
Scintilla's upgradability is a testament to its forward-thinking design, ensuring the network remains adaptable in the face of evolving blockchain technologies and user needs. By prioritizing modular architecture and leveraging the strengths of the Cosmos ecosystem, Scintilla is well-positioned to grow, innovate, and serve as a dynamic platform for decentralized applications and services.


Through careful planning, community involvement, and a commitment to seamless transitions, Scintilla is dedicated to ensuring that upgrades enhance network functionality, security, and user experience. As the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, Scintilla's upgradable framework stands as a pillar of its long-term vision for an open, decentralized internet.
