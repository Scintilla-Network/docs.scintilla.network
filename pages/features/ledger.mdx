# Core Features

## Scalability

Scintilla confronts the blockchain sector's paramount challenge—scalability—head-on, ensuring swift transaction processing without sacrificing security or decentralization.
Its innovative modular architecture supports parallel processing, enabling simultaneous transactions across various modules, efficient data segregation, and network upgrades without the necessity for hard forks or community wars.

## Decentralized Identity

The Identity Module provides a robust framework for managing digital identities, leveraging blockchain's inherent security and transparency to facilitate trustless interactions and verifiable credentials.
Reputation and public/private/role-based identities associated data are features of the module, allowing for a wider range of use cases.

## **Security**

Leveraging a dual Proof of Work (PoW)/Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus model, Scintilla enhances network security, making it resilient against Sybil attacks and anchoring its economic model to productive output.

## Interoperability and Liquidity

Scintilla introduces a liquidity layer (via the Market Module) within the network to facilitate asset exchanges and interoperability with other blockchains.
This allows for the development of cross-chain applications and the fluid transfer of digital assets across diverse networks, ensuring a programmable interaction with external assets.

## Quorums
Validators form the Scintilla Quorum, ensuring network integrity through collective decision-making, block validation, and state management.
They ensure regulatory compliance and support decentralized identity and business verification.
The Quorum operates on an daily epoch system, maintaining security and control over Scintilla's operations.
Banking nodes and metachains may have their own quorum, described as part of the `quorum` record of the metachain identity.
