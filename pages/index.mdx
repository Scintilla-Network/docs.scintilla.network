# Introduction

Welcome to Scintilla Network's Documentation !
This documentation is a living document that will be updated regularly to reflect the latest features, improvements, and best practices for developing on the Scintilla Network.

## What is Scintilla?

Scintilla is a groundbreaking blockchain network designed to revolutionize the way digital assets and computations are transferred and stored across a decentralized ecosystem.
At its core, Scintilla introduces a modular, scalable, and highly efficient protocol that empowers developers, enterprises, and individuals to create, manage, exchange or programatically control their assets.
Birthed from the RWA (Real World Assets) ecosystem scalability and interoperability challenges, Scintilla is engineered to address the limitations of existing blockchain networks, offering a comprehensive suite of tools and infrastructure to support a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and beyond.


### Core Features

##### **Modularity**

Scintilla's architecture is built on a dual-layer foundation. It's Layer 1 allows for distinct but interoperable modules, each tailored to specific functionalities such as identity verification, smart contracts, data store and asset tokenization.
This modular approach ensures flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration while allowing all those system to have their own consensus and governance, making it a truly decentralized network.
Modules are permissionless, up to validators to decide which modules they agree to pin-in or out (for instance, if regulators forbid a specific module, validators can protect themselves by not include it in the network).

##### **Scalability**

Addressing one of the blockchain industry's chief challenges, Scintilla is designed to scale efficiently, supporting a high throughput of transactions without compromising security or decentralization.
This is done via its network's modular architecture, allowing for parallel processing, enabling multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously across different modules, data to be segregated and processed in parallel, and the network to be upgraded without requiring a hard fork.

##### **EVM Compatibility**

Through its Smart Contract Module, Scintilla offers full retro-compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts and dApps seamlessly within the Scintilla ecosystem.

##### **Decentralized Identity**

The Identity Module provides a robust framework for managing digital identities, leveraging blockchain's inherent security and transparency to facilitate trustless interactions and verifiable credentials.

##### **Security**

By having a dual PoW/PoS consensus (making sybil attacks more expensive than via PoW or PoS alone and links economics to an actual output production), Scintilla ensures the network's security and integrity, while also providing a robust governance model that allows for the evolution of the network in a decentralized manner.

### Objective

Scintilla aims for the ability to create, manage, and exchange digital assets with unprecedented ease and flexibility.
Whether you're developing innovative dApps, issuing digital tokens, or seeking to implement blockchain solutions for business, Scintilla provides the tools and infrastructure necessary to bring your ideas to life.
